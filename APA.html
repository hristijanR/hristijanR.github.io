    <title>Less air pollution</title>
</body>
    
<div id="main">
<p>Riding public transit, when you can, is beneficial in many ways. Economically, it is cost effective - especially with soaring gas prices. It also reduces your stress levels -- someone else is driving. And, it goes a long way toward helping our environment â€“ it conserves natural resources, reduces air pollution and harmful ozone levels. When it comes to our environment, riding public transit makes a big difference.</p>

<p><h2>How Public Transit Helps Conserve Energy:</h2></p>

   <p> A bus with as few as seven passengers is more fuel-efficient than the average single-occupant auto used for commuting.</p>
    The fuel efficiency of a fully occupied bus is six times greater than that of the average single-occupant auto.</p>
   <p> The fuel efficiency of a fully-occupied train car is 15 times greater than that of the average commuter's single-occupant auto.</p>
   <p>In terms of energy consumption per passenger mile (energy used to transport one passenger one mile), transit is more energy efficient.</p>
    <p>Buses use 8.7% less energy per passenger mile than a typical automobile.</p>
    Commuter trains use 23.7% less energy per passenger mile than a typical automobile.</p>

<p><h2>How Public Transit Helps Reduce Air Pollution:</h2></p>

    <p>Public transit moves people efficiently while producing significantly less air pollution to move one passenger one mile -- compared to moving a person one mile in a single-occupant auto.</p>
    <p>Buses emit only 20% as much carbon monoxide per passenger mile as a single-occupant auto.</p>
    <p>Buses emit only 10% as many hydrocarbons per passenger mile as a single-occupant auto (hydrocarbons are VOCs -- an ozone precursor).</p>
    <p>Buses emit only 75% as many nitrogen oxides (another ozone precursor) per passenger mile as a single-occupant auto.</p>
    <p>Trains emit only 25% as many nitrogen oxides per passenger mile as a single-occupant auto, and nearly 100% less hydrocarbons and carbon monoxides.</p>

<p>Clearly, riding public transit throughout the year makes a big difference in our air quality and use of natural resources. During the summer months, when harmful ozone levels are highest, riding public transit makes an even greater difference -- especially for those with health and breathing problems. Ride Transit. It is the Smart and Healthy Way to Go!</p>
