        <p><h2>Advantages of using <a href="bus.html">public transportation</a></h2></p>
    
        <p>Public transportation systems bring many benefits to individuals, communities, and the local economy, but all too often, they don't get near the amount of attention that they should. While much of the media is attention is focused on higher profile stories such as autonomous vehicles and the launch of the latest Tesla electric car model, public transportation and fixed route transit services continue to be much more efficient and beneficial systems of getting people from one place to another, which often gets overlooked in the news cycle's desire for shiny new things.
        As a counterbalance to that, here are 9 benefits that buses, light rail, trains, shuttles, and other forms of public transportation bring to the table.</p>

        It benefits communities financially:
        For every dollar invested in public transportation, approximately $4 in economic returns are generated, and for every $1 billion in investments in the sector, 50,000 jobs are created and supported. An investment of $10 million in public transportation generates about $32 million in increased business sales, and residential property values for homes located near public transit with high frequency service "performed 42% better on average." In fact, it has been stated that the hidden economic value of public transit could be up to $1.8 billion per year per city, which is a considerable amount of capital.</p>
        <p>Public transportation reduces air pollution:
        By moving people more efficiently, public transit produces significantly <a href="APA.html">less air pollution</a> per passenger mile than a standard car carrying a single driver. Buses emit 20% less carbon monoxide, 10% as much hydrocarbons, and 75% as much nitrogen oxides per passenger mile than an automobile with a single occupant. </p>

        <p>Increased fuel efficiency:
        Along with reducing air pollution, public transportation is also more fuel efficient per passenger mile, which contributes to an overall decrease in the amount of energy necessary for transportation. APTA states that public transportation in the US is responsible for saving 4.2 billion gallons of gasoline each year.</p>
    
        <p>Reduced traffic congestion:
        Public transportation can convey many more people in much less space than individual automobiles, which helps to keep traffic congestion lower, which in turn reduces air pollution from idling vehicles, and helps riders avoid the stress that comes from daily driving in highly congested areas.</p>

        <p>Saves money:
        Taking public transportation instead of owning a second vehicle can save (on average) more than $9,823 a year, and for those who ride instead of driving the primary vehicle, can save individuals a significant amount of money each month in avoided gas, maintenance, parking, and other expenses.</p>

        Increases mobility:
        For those who don't, or can't, drive, public transportation allows them to get to work, to school, to the    grocery store or doctor's office, or just to visit friends, without having to engage a friend or relative to do the driving.</p>

        <p>Frees up time:
        Taking public transportation can free up a significant amount of time and attention, as someone else is doing the driving, which allows riders to spend their transit time reading, working, studying, or being entertained instead of having to watch the road. It can also reduce commute time, with one study claiming that Americans living in areas with public transportation save some 850 million hours of travel time each year.</p>

        <p>Public transportation is safer:
        Taking the bus, train, light rail, or other transit options is safer than driving a car, not only in terms of the safety of the vehicles themselves, which are maintained much more regularly than a personal car, but also in terms of the driving habits and training of the operators. Transit operators, and the ones that work for National Express Transit in particular, receive much more training than the average automobile driver (120 minimum hours of training) and also receive refresher training on a regular basis as well. Statistically, bus- and train-related accidents happen at a lesser rate, and with much lower passenger fatality rates than car travel does. In addition, most transit centers have higher levels of security monitoring and reduced crime rates than other areas.</p> 

        <p>Encourages healthier habits:
        Public transportation is linked to healthier lifestyles, as people who use public transportation are said to  get more than three times the amount of physical activity per day than those who don’t, just from walking to and from their transit stops and their final destination.</p>

        <p>Public transportation contributes to both the economical and physical health of individuals, it brings financial benefits to communities, and it provides not only jobs in the industry itself, but is also a key component of a healthy business ecosystem by increasing mobility options for both job commuters and customers alike.</p>
    
  
    <p><h2>Advantages of using <a href="bike.html">bikes</a></h2></p>
    <p>We're continuing our look at smart ways to start saddling up and using bicycles for real transportation.

We've always taken the greenness of bike transport as a given. But if you're just getting started — or perhaps trying to convince an employer that bicycle commuting is a good thing — we've rounded up a dozen reasons to leave that car in the driveway and start covering pavement on two wheels. Let's ride!</p>

<p>It's easier to finance a new bicycle than a new car. Thanks to the recession, auto loans are hard to find these days — even if you have good credit. But for the price of a single car payment, you can buy a well-made bicycle that should outlast most cars. Add a few hundred dollars more for rain gear, lights and accessories, and you have all-weather, anytime transportation.</p>

<p>A bicycle has a tiny manufacturing footprint when compared to a car. All manufactured goods have environmental impact, but bicycles can be produced for a fraction of the materials, energy and shipping costs of a car.</p>

<p>Bicycles produce no meaningful pollution when in operation. Bikes don't have tailpipes belching poisonous fumes into the atmosphere. They also eliminate the oil, fuel and hydraulic fluids dripped by automobiles onto the road surface — which means less toxic runoff into local waterways.</p>

<p>Bikes save taxpayers money by reducing road wear. A 20-pound bicycle is a lot less rough on the pavement than a two-ton sedan. Every bicycle on the road amounts to money saved patching potholes and resurfacing city streets.</p>

<p>Bicycles are an effective alternative to a second car. Perhaps you're not in a position to adopt a bicycle as primary transportation. But bikes make great second vehicles. You can literally save thousands of dollars a year using a bicycle for workday commuting and weekend errands in households which might otherwise be forced to maintain two cars.</p>

<p>Using a bike for transportation can help you lose weight and improve your overall health. The health benefits of regular aerobic exercise are well-known. Depending on your riding style and local road conditions, you could easily burn 600 calories an hour through brisk cycling. Most bike commuters report losing 15 to 20 pounds during their first year in the saddle without changing their eating habits.</p>
<p>You can store a dozen bicycles in a single automobile-sized parking place. Parking lots have enormous environmental and financial impact, particularly in urbanized areas. The more bikes you can get on the road, the fewer parking spaces you need to build.</p>

<p>Bicycles don't burn gasoline. Fuel is cheap compared to last year, and the economic downturn is likely to keep a lid on petroleum demand for a while. But we're not producing any more oil today than we were when it was more than $100 a barrel. A healthy bike culture will help ease pressure on supply once demand returns.</p>

<p>Bicycling may be faster and more efficient than taking a car. We're not talking about the crazy — and illegal — antics of New York bicycle messengers. But bikes are often faster than cars in urban areas, especially when city designers have set aside proper bike lanes. There's nothing more satisfying as a bicycle commuter than breezing past a long line of gridlocked traffic.</p>

<p>Bikes cost much less to maintain and operate than automobiles. You'll never throw a rod on a bicycle, and dropping a transmission on a bike usually means replacing a bent derailleur hanger or worn-out chain. Bicycles do require service, but you can learn to perform most of it yourself. Even if you have a shop do things for you, costs will be trivial compared to a car.</p>

<p>Bicycles provide mobility for those who may not qualify or afford to drive. Not everyone can get a driver's license (or wants one), and the cost of purchasing, insuring and maintaining a car is out of reach for a lot of people. Almost everyone can afford some sort of bike. Other than walking, bicycles are the most cost-effective transportation on the planet.</p>

<p>Studies show that bicycle commuters are healthier, more productive, and require less time off at work. This is why most enlightened employers are eager to accommodate commuting cyclists. Healthy workers are better workers — and that's good for the bottom line. Bikes are smart business. </p>
